# üìû Udgam25: Voice-Based Automated Customer Care System

This repository contains the code for a **Voice-Based Automated Customer Care System**, developed as part of **Udgam '25**, the flagship event of **E-Cell, IIT Guwahati**. The system simulates a real-time customer-salesperson telephonic conversation using state-of-the-art **speech recognition**, **natural language understanding**, and **text-to-speech** generation ‚Äî all integrated through **Twilio** for live call functionality.

## üöÄ Project Overview

### üìå Objective
To create an **AI-powered voice agent** that:
- Listens to customer queries via phone call
- Understands and generates human-like responses
- Speaks the responses back to the customer
- Supports basic **negotiation, product queries, and customer support** simulation

## üß† System Pipeline

Incoming Call ‚Üí Speech-to-Text ‚Üí Response Generation ‚Üí Text-to-Speech ‚Üí Twilio Audio Response


### 1. **Speech-to-Text**
- **Model Used**: Facebook‚Äôs **Wav2Vec 2.0**
- **Library**: ü§ó `transformers`, `torchaudio`, `soundfile`
- Converts customer's spoken query to text in real-time

### 2. **Text Response Generation**
- **Model Used**: `T5ForConditionalGeneration` from HuggingFace
- **Training Dataset**: Dialogues between customer and salesperson
- **Function**: Generates context-aware responses simulating negotiation or support

### 3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
- Converts generated response text back to audio
- **Tools Used**:
  - `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech)
  - `TTS` by Coqui.ai (for realistic voices)

### 4. **Call Integration**
- **Service Used**: [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
- Handles:
  - Incoming customer calls
  - Audio streaming
  - Outgoing voice responses

## üß™ Sample Flow

1. **Customer Says**: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the price of the redmi phone?‚Äù
2. **Wav2Vec2**: Transcribes to: `"what is the price of the redmi phone"`
3. **T5 Model**: Generates: `"The Redmi phone is priced at ‚Çπ12,999. Would you like a discount?"`
4. **TTS**: Speaks this back to the user over the phone using Twilio
